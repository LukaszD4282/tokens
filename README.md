**Momentum Design Tokens** is a design token project to provide standardization of themes and colors to downstream [Momentum Design](https://momentum.design/) projects.

See [documentation on Confluence](https://confluence-eng-gpk2.cisco.com/conf/display/~pauwitty/Token+proposal).

## **DEPRECATION NOTICE**

This package will be deprecated in favor of the [**@momentum-design/tokens**](https://github.com/momentum-design/momentum-design/tree/main/packages/%40momentum-design/tokens) package. The source tokens of the superseding package are maintained by **Momentum Design** designers directly, and will update as tokens are modified and published by designers.

The contents of this package will remain in its current state, available for open contributions, but will no longer be maintained by a dedicated engineering team.

**Note**: The superseding library is currently under development, but does contain a 1:1 reference to the existing _theme_ tokens available here. Please see our [migration guide](https://github.com/momentum-design/tokens/blob/master/MIGRATION.md) for more information on how to migrate from the distributable of this project to the distributable of its superseding project.

Please see the following package details for any additional guides relative to usage and consumption of the superseding package:

- [**@momentum-design/tokens**](https://github.com/momentum-design/momentum-design/tree/main/packages/%40momentum-design/tokens) - Token assets. [NPMJS Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@momentum-design/tokens)

## Overview

This project is built with the following goals:

- **Simplicity** - Tokens should be easily built and consumed
- **Themed** - Tokens should be designed with theming in mind
- **Extensible** - Usage of multiple tokens should work seemlessly

## Getting Started

Please review our [getting started guide](./GETTING_STARTED.md) for details on how to prepare this project for downstream consumption.
